# Claude Code Instructions

Adapte from andrej-karpathy-skills/claud.md

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

# Personal Instructions

## Restrictions

- Do NOT try to access anything on AWS (S3, etc.) directly
- Do NOT run commands that make network requests to AWS services
- Do NOT execute code outside the scope of current conversation
- Do NOT write imports inside functions, methods, or classes - always place imports at the top of the file
- Always briefly highlight main changes and ask for approval before making changes.
- Do not use imports inside functions, all imports must be at the top of the file.
- Do not right functions inside a function or methods of a class, unless this function will be used in this function or method specifically.
- Never run pip or conda command
- Always confirm before run command from terminal
- Never check .env file under any folder

## Documentations
overview.md will be high level instroction ans summary of the project. This file shall contain a Roadmap section to list Stages to follow. While in document/adr and documents/log will record PR. Starting from main branch, adr and log file names shall be in format of 0000-<name>.md and pr-0-<name>.md. The first PR correspond to the first branch will have 0001-<name>.md and pr-1-<name>.md. In each pr file under log/ folder, it shall have a TODO list which usually corresponding to Stages in overview.md, but it will be a more detailed version. tech.md will be technological decision and techniques is adopted. 

## Session Management
When the context window (auto-compact) reaches 30% remaining, remind me to update relevant .md files, to make sure smooth transaction between conversation sessions. for example:
- Update current status, completed steps, and next actions
- Note any key decisions made in this session
- Confirm all important context is captured before starting a new session
let me know where the new session shall start from afterwards.

## Review before moving on
- Read through code and documents, make sure all are consistent with each other, at the end of each phase before next phase in Roadmap of the development plan.
